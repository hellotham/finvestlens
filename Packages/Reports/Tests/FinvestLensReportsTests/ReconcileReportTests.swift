//  The reconcile report's whole claim is an identity: every posting is
//  reconciled, cleared or outstanding — exactly one of the three — so the three
//  totals must add back to the account's balance. A report whose parts do not
//  sum to the whole is worse than no report, so that is what these pin, along
//  with the one figure GnuCash has already agreed: the reconciled balance.
