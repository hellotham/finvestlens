//  Telling the user when the query did something they didn't ask for.
//
//  `date:2026` looks like an operator and isn't one, so it is searched as
//  literal text and finds nothing. The search was never wrong — it was silent,
//  and silence is the bug: the results pane only appeared when there were
//  results, so a query that matched nothing dropped you back on the dashboard
//  with no sign it had run.
