# Deferred backlog (P0–P5)

Tracks items that were in scope for a completed phase but deferred, partial, or
never run. Intentional non-goals (e.g. bit-for-bit arithmetic parity with
GnuCash) are **not** listed.

**Status of the functional backlog:** all functional deficits below have been
**implemented** (see the "Resolved" section). The only items still outstanding
are **CI** and **GnuCash round-trip fidelity / perf validation**, deliberately
left for later.

## Still outstanding (intentionally deferred)

| Item | Origin | Status | Notes | Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CI pipeline + file-header/coverage gate | P0 | absent | Tests run locally; no `.github`. | P6 |
| 100k-txn perf validation (local + SMB/NFS) | P1 (NFR-02, OD-1/2/3) | not-run | Go/no-go for GRDB direct-mode vs working-copy. | P6 |
| Round-trip corpus CI gate | P3 | partial | Interop verified manually via `gnucash-cli`. **14 Jul 2026:** deep round-trip on a real 8.5 MB book (560 accounts, 46,578 txns, 102,706 prices) now **CLEAN** — full graph + balances identical, double export byte-identical. Found & fixed: template-transactions ROOT hijacked the book (orphaning every real account), price/amount precision loss (exporter rounded to currency SCU; now exact rationals with continued-fraction recovery for FX cross-rates), book GUID not re-imported. Re-runnable harness: `FL_ROUNDTRIP_FILE=… swift test --filter LiveFileRoundTripTests`; CI automation still pending. | P6 |
| ~~Richer slot (KVP) round-trip~~ | P3 | **done** | **14 Jul 2026:** all slots on book/account/transaction/split are preserved verbatim through import/export (nested frames, lists, gdate/timespec, guid, numeric, integer); `notes` is lifted into `Account.notes`/`Transaction.notes`. Verified on the real 8.5 MB book (18,646 notes, 3,944 online_id, colours, reconcile-info) — round-trip clean incl. KVP equality. **Commodity fidelity closed too (14 Jul 2026):** `Commodity` gained `exchangeCode`/`getQuotes`/`quoteSource`/`quoteTimezone`/`kvp` (identity stays namespace+mnemonic; backward-compatible Codable + sqlite v2 migration), so `cmdty:xcode`, quote config, and `cmdty:slots` (`user_symbol`) round-trip. The live harness now also compares the export against the **original** file's inventory (slot-key multiset, entity + cmdty element counts) — clean on the real book. | done |
| Budgets/scheduled/business in native GnuCash slots | P3 | partial | Persist as KVP-JSON, not GnuCash XML slots. | P7 |
| iCloud Documents container | P6 (FR-PLT-02) | needs-capability | Sync machinery done + storage-agnostic; enabling the container needs a dev team/provisioning. | P6+ |
| Widgets | P6 (FR-PLT-03) | needs-target | WidgetKit extension target; IntentSupport summaries ready to feed it. | P6+ |
| Quick Look preview | P6 (FR-PLT-03) | needs-target | Quick Look extension target. | P6+ |
| Push notifications for alerts | P6 (FR-PLAN-05) | needs-entitlement | Alerts engine + dashboard done; UNUserNotificationCenter delivery pending. | P6+ |
| Localization (string catalogs) | P6 (NFR-06) | absent | Accessibility labels done; UI strings not yet localized. | P6+ |

## GnuCash parity audit — accounts & transactions (15 Jul 2026)

Audited the register and account functions against a real GnuCash 5.x running
the same book, menu by menu. Three **bugs** came out of it and are fixed
(`EditFidelityTests` pins each; every one was verified to fail with its fix
reverted):

| Bug | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Editing a transaction destroyed share counts and split memos | `EditableSplit` carried only account + amount, so `commit()` rebuilt every split with `quantity: nil` (→ defaults to value) and `memo: ""`. Re-saving an unchanged 100-share/$1,000 buy left **1000 shares**, memo gone. Balance checks can't see it: the *values* still balance. | The editor row carries `quantity`/`memo` through untouched; `asInput` is the single exit point. Verified in the GUI on the real book: the 11,600-share AGL buy re-saves with 11,600 shares and Net Worth unmoved. |
| Voided splits still moved the register's running balance | `Book.balance` excludes voided (`Book.matches`), `refreshRegister` did not — so the register's last balance disagreed with the sidebar and every report. | The row still shows with its amount and `v`; it no longer moves the balance. |
| No Unvoid, and the R column silently un-voided | `cycleReconcileState`'s `default` mapped voided → `n`, one split at a time. | `unvoidTransaction`/`isVoided` added (context menu shows Void or Unvoid); the cycle leaves voided **and** frozen alone. |

Parity gaps found, not yet built (ranked):

| Item | Notes | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Search results are read-only | GnuCash's Find opens results **as an editable register** — that is its bulk edit. Ours is a `Table` with no selection/context menu/jump, and a non-empty query hijacks the detail pane. Result rows already carry the txn GUID, so a jump is cheap. | P7 |
| No structured Find, no ⌘F, no Find Account | GnuCash: 16 criteria, all/any, refine/add/delete-results. Ours: one free-text field, 5 AND-only operators (`tag:`/`account:`/`memo:`/`desc:`/`amount:`); no date, notes, number or reconcile-state search. An unknown key (`date:2026`) silently degrades to a literal substring. | P7 |
| Register Sort By / Filter By | GnuCash sorts by 10 fields (+reverse, save) and filters by date range + 5 statuses. Ours: hardcoded oldest-first, no filter, headers not sortable. | P7 |
| Double-line mode | `Transaction.notes` is stored and round-trips but is never shown or editable. | P7 |
| Register ops absent | Cut/Copy/Paste transaction, Blank-transaction in-register entry, Go to Date (⌘G), Edit Exchange Rate on an existing txn, Schedule-from-transaction, Auto-Split Ledger style. | P7/P8 |
| Register ops unreachable | Every txn action is context-menu-only — no menu-bar items, no shortcuts, and none available in Journal/General Ledger style. | P7 |
| Per-split memo/action fields | Now preserved through an edit, but still not *editable* — GnuCash shows both per split. | P7 |
| Account gaps | Cascade Account Properties, Auto-clear, Open SubAccounts (subtree register), account-tree filter, reconcile report. Delete Account has no move-transactions-to; type/commodity not editable after creation; hidden accounts always shown (no toggle). | P7/P8 |
| Data ahead of UI | `setReconcileState` (all 5 states), multi-trigger AND/OR rules, `setNotes`, rule groups, `Book.allTags` all exist and are tested but have no surface. Wiring, not building. | P7 |

## Usability review (July 2026)

Resolved in the usability pass: File/Book menu bar (New/Open/Open Recent/
Import GnuCash/Export/Close/Revert + every tool panel with shortcuts), lean
toolbar with a Tools menu, GnuCash import UI (File menu + welcome screen),
price-target editor, account re-parenting, stale-lock Break-Lock recovery,
iCloud conflict-version resolution in the external-change banner, welcome
recents.

Still deferred:

| Item | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| App Sandbox | Disabled by decision (13 Jul 2026): sibling `.lock` files at user-selected locations are denied by the sandbox; related-item declaration + coordinated I/O are in place but macOS still refused. Direct (notarized) distribution doesn't need the sandbox. Revisit before any Mac App Store submission. |
| iOS document flows | New/Open panels are AppKit on macOS; iOS uses fileImporter. First run in the simulator 14 Jul 2026: welcome → Open… → Files picker → book opens and renders. **New Book fixed (14 Jul 2026):** iOS books are created in the app's Documents directory (visible in Files under "On My iPhone ▸ finvestlens") with non-colliding Untitled/Untitled 2 naming — no longer the purgeable temporary directory. Still open: a move/rename flow for new books. **GnuCash/bank-file import and export are intentionally macOS/iPadOS-only** (`FR-PLT-06`, PRD §5.15) — iPhone is open/create/edit only, so their absence on iOS is by design, not a gap. |
| ~~iOS: open a book from iCloud Drive / Files~~ | **Done (14 Jul 2026):** coordinated reads materialise dataless files; security-scoped access held for the session with bookmark-backed recents; lockless fallback (Architecture §6.1/§6.3) where the sibling `.lock` can't be created. Verified: Box Drive + iCloud Drive (incl. evicted file) on macOS, Files-picker open in the iOS simulator. Dropbox uses the same File Provider mechanism as Box (not separately tested — not installed). | 

## HIG review (13 Jul 2026)

Fixed: undo/redo (pre-capture, Edit menu integrated), save-on-quit via
NSApplicationDelegate (⌘Q never loses data, releases the lock), Reports in
its own window, window titled with document proxy icon, Esc/⌘. cancels
sheets (+ Return confirms reconcile), toolbar help tags, Title Case buttons.

Known nuances / still deferred:

| Item | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Esc inside a focused text field | AppKit's field editor consumes the raw Escape (completion); ⌘. always cancels, Esc works otherwise. SwiftUI offers no clean override. |
| ~~Undo action names~~ | **Done (15 Jul 2026):** pre-capture undo names each edit at the call site, so the Edit menu reads "Undo Delete Transaction", "Undo Change Reconcile State", etc. |
| Window/state restoration | App launches to the splash; does not reopen the last book automatically. |
| Help menu | No help book / anchors. |

## 1.0 PRD audit (13 Jul 2026)

Full code review against the PRD before tagging 1.0. Fixed during the audit:
hardcoded AUD in the transaction editor (now derives the transaction currency
from the splits' accounts), silent save failures on book-switch/quit/conflict
resolution (now surfaced, quit cancels on failure), transaction-editor errors
no longer silently dismissed, **lock heartbeat timer** (idle books no longer
go stale-breakable), **autosave** (5-minute interval), stale importer/OFX
comments.

Known 1.0 scope limits (post-1.0 backlog, in priority order):

| Item | FR | Notes | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| QIF splits + investment actions | FR-XIO-01 | Parser handles flat D/T/U/P/M/N/L cash rows only; `S/E/$` splits and `!Type:Invst` actions dropped. | P8 |
| OFX investment statements | FR-XIO-02 | Only `<STMTTRN>` cash rows parsed; `<INVBUY>`/`<INVSELL>` ignored (use the Stock Assistant). | P8 |
| CSV price import | FR-XIO-03 | CSV imports transactions only. | P8 |
| CSV export | FR-XIO-06 | No CSV export (GnuCash XML export covers interchange). | P8 |
| CSV mapping profiles | FR-XIO-08 | Column mapping is per-import; no saved profiles. | P8 |
| GnuCash `sx:`/budget/business import | FR-IMP-03/05 | Counted as import warnings; FinvestLens keeps its own in KVP slots. | P7/P8 |
| Savings goals / piggy banks | FR-GOAL-01 | Not implemented. | P9 |
| Twelve Data quote provider | FR-INV-03b | Yahoo/EODHD/Alpha Vantage/Finnhub shipped; Twelve Data/Stooq not. | P8 |
| Scheduled-split formulas | FR-SCH-02 | Fixed amounts only. | P8 |
| Re-open a finished reconciliation | FR-REC-03 | Begin/toggle/finish/cancel only. | P8 |
| Loan amortization assistant | FR-SCH-04 | Not implemented. | P9 |
| Transaction attachments | FR-REG-10 | Not implemented. | P8 |
| Check printing | FR-REG-11 | Not implemented. | P9 |
| Open Read-Only on live lock | §6.1 | Open fails with holder info + Break-Lock; no read-only mode. | P7 |
| Autosave interval setting | §3 | Fixed 5 min; not user-configurable/disableable yet. | P7 |
| Business (P7), bank sync/MT940/CAMT (P8), planners (P9) | FR-BUS, FR-XIO-04/07, FR-PLAN-10.. | Post-1.0 phases per plan.md. | P7–P9 |

## Apple Intelligence (13 Jul 2026)

Post-1.0 addition of the `Intelligence` package (FR-AI-01…06, Architecture
§11). Fixed along the way (pre-existing 1.0 bugs uncovered by GUI testing):
**File-menu Save/Revert/Import/Export/Close Book were silently missing**
(`CommandGroup(after: .saveItem)` has no anchor in a plain WindowGroup —
re-anchored to `.newItem`), and **bank-file import never presented its picker
on macOS** (SwiftUI `.fileImporter` unreliable here; replaced with NSOpenPanel,
deferred out of the view-update transaction).

Known limits:

| Item | FR | Notes | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Guardrail refusals | FR-AI-05 | On-device safety layer deterministically refuses some borderline inputs; budget advisor retries simplified phrasing then falls back to average-based plan. Other features surface a friendly message. | monitor |
| Scanned-statement OCR quality | FR-AI-01 | Vision OCR fallback is untested against real bank scans; digital-PDF reflow is solid. | P8 |
| Statement sign inference without balance column | FR-AI-01 | Signs are re-derived from the running balance; statements with unsigned debit/credit columns *and* no balance column may import with wrong signs (review screen catches). | P8 |
| ~~Invoice → attachment link~~ | FR-AI-03 | **Done (FR-AI-08):** Smart Import copies applied invoice/dividend PDFs into the document folder and links them via the GnuCash `assoc_uri` slot ("Open Linked Document" in the register). Manual attach from the transaction editor is still not offered. | done / P8 |
| iOS file pickers | FR-AI-01/03/04/07 | iOS keeps `.fileImporter`; not yet exercised on-device. | P8 |
| Smart Import: create transaction from unmatched invoice | FR-AI-07 | An invoice with no matching register transaction reports "import the bank statement first"; direct creation (with funding-account picker) not offered yet. | P8 |
| ~~statementDate in GnuCash XML~~ | FR-AI-07 | **Done (14 Jul 2026):** with generic KVP round-trip, the `finvestlens/statement-date` slot now rides through XML export/import (timespec, full fidelity), so dual-date duplicate detection survives a GnuCash round-trip. GnuCash itself ignores but preserves the slot. | done |
| Live-model tests under load | — | `LiveModelTests` can time out when the model daemon is busy; they self-skip without Apple Intelligence. Not in CI. | monitor |
| ~~Opening a book blocks the main thread~~ | FR-DOC-01 | **Done (15 Jul 2026):** `FinvestLensDocument.load` is isolated to a `DocumentLoader` global actor and returns `sending FinvestLensDocument`, so the graph is built off the main actor and transferred without making `Book` `Sendable` (Architecture §12.6). `AppModel.open`/`openBook` are `async`; the root view shows "Opening <book>…" while `openingURL` is set, and `openBook` guards on `isOpening` so a second click mid-load can't open a second document over the first. Verified in the GUI on the Ashley Bears book: window live throughout, Net Worth/Assets/a card account unchanged to the cent. `DocumentLoaderTests` pins the executor off the main thread. | done |
| ~~Refreshing derived state re-sorts every price~~ | FR-DOC-01 | **Done (15 Jul 2026):** `priceRows`/`rateRows` are derived on demand behind a cache dropped in `refreshAll()`/`close()`, with a `derivedRevision` counter carrying the observation dependency (Architecture §12.5). `refreshAll` (release) **0.158s → 0.041s**; 0.174s → 0.062s with a 9,018-split register selected. Note the old "0.25s per edit" was a *debug* figure — see §12.7. `LazyPriceRowTests` pins cache invalidation on edit and close. | done |
| `rebuildAccountTree` re-walks the book per edit | FR-DOC-01 | With prices lazy, the remaining ~0.04s of every `refreshAll()` is `rebuildAccountTree` (single-pass balances + one conversion per account) and `runSearch`. Fast enough to feel instant; the next move, if ever needed, is to rebuild only the affected subtree. | P8 |
