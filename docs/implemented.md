# Implemented — history, audits & fixes (P0–P7)

The record of what has been **built and verified**. **Every phase P0–P9 is
complete**: the engine, native document + NAS locking, GnuCash import/export,
core UX, everyday finance, investments + multi-currency + quotes,
sync/dashboard/alerts, Apple Intelligence, small-business features, extended
statement import (SWIFT MT + ISO 20022), and the planning & insights layer —
plus two **July 2026 redesigns**: usability & performance, and report
quality. [deferred.md](deferred.md) lists the smaller open tails.

This file is the narrative: what each audit found, what was fixed, and how it
was verified (mostly against a real GnuCash book — 46,553 transactions, 559
accounts, 102,706 prices, multi-currency — compared side by side with GnuCash
5.16, matching to the cent). New history is appended here; open work goes to
deferred.md.

## Full-codebase review pass (25 Jul 2026)

A max-effort review of the entire codebase against the PRD, Architecture and
Plan (ten independent finder angles → per-candidate adversarial verification →
a gap sweep; 63 distinct candidates, 60 confirmed, 2 refuted). Everything
confirmed was fixed the same day; all nine suites green (1,094 tests, +29
regression pins) and both platform targets build.

**Money-correctness fixes (engine & import).** Stock splits now rescale open
*short* positions (both FIFO/LIFO and average-cost — a split while short
previously produced phantom lots and overstated gains); Scrub no longer flags
the single-split zero-value stock-split shape as degenerate (GnuCash's own
scrub accepts it — Check & Repair used to nag forever); Close Book **aborts**
(preview warns, toast on execute) when the equity account is
foreign-denominated and no exchange rate exists, instead of silently booking
the unconverted figure; a weekend-back-adjusted first occurrence is no longer
dropped when the query window ends just before the nominal start (bills came
due late); `statementDate` survives a GnuCash-XML round-trip (the getter now
reads the `timespec` flavour the importer produces); CAMT booked reversals
keep `CdtDbtInd`'s sign — the extra `RvslInd` flip inverted every reversal
(ISO 20022 defines the indicator as the reversal entry's own direction; the
fixture was corrected against the standard); lone-decimal-comma amounts
("4,99") no longer parse 100× too large, and the Intelligence layer now
delegates to the one importer parser instead of a drifted copy; OFX values are
entity-decoded; a UTF-8 BOM is stripped at every import decode; the matcher's
verbatim-reference pass now requires the money to agree (recycled cheque
numbers swallowed real rows) and payee learning skips wash accounts; QIF
`RtrnCap` maps to return-of-capital (was booked as dividend income); OFX
investment rows are labelled from `SECLIST` tickers, not raw CUSIPs.

**Data-safety fixes (persistence & app).** FileLock: the heartbeat re-checks
on-disk ownership (a machine waking from sleep used to clobber a legitimately
re-assigned lock — the loss is now surfaced as a toast and the session falls
back to fingerprint-guarded saves); breaking a stale lock re-reads inside the
delete so two racing breakers can't both acquire; an unreadable/corrupt lock
file now reads as a stale unknown holder (Break Lock offered) instead of
silently disabling locking. The SQLite loader never drops a row over a corrupt
GUID — accounts, transactions and prices mint a counted random identity like
splits always did, so the load-warnings toast reports it. Posting scheduled
transactions is one whole-book undo action (⌘Z used to rewind `lastPosted`
but leave the transactions — reposting duplicated them); Revert and
reload-from-disk clear the undo stack (stale snapshots could rewrite the
adopted book); investment imports stamp the broker FITID as `online_id` and
the review flags already-imported trades (re-importing an overlapping broker
file used to re-create every trade); Split-from-Invoice preserves the funding
leg's identity (saving used to clear its reconcile state);
duplicate/copy-paste carry tags; every money-entry sheet parses with the
strict whole-string parser ("4,001.23" typed into Reconcile used to start the
session against $4).

**Correct statuses & guarded intelligence.** Bills: a blank-description
schedule never matches a blank-description transaction; a bill due today is
*due*, not overdue (day granularity); name matches must also agree on amount
within ±25% (FR-BILL-01's expected-amount matching — a $5 coffee named "Rent"
no longer settles the rent). Income above its budget is favourable — no more
"Over budget: Salary" (alerts filter income lines; the budget row now reads
"Ahead by"). FR-PLAN-05's fifth alert kind, **unusual spend**, is implemented
(current month ≥2× the trailing six-month average and ≥$100 over — transparent
arithmetic in the message). FR-GOAL-01's **goal-to-bill link** shipped (goal
editor picker + row badge). The review-deck story validator's blanket
1900–2100 "calendar year" exemption is gone — only ungrouped years the slide's
own facts name (label years expanded, ±1) pass ungrounded, so a fabricated
"$2,000" is rejected again; statement sign-correction votes on the account
convention per statement, so positive-owed-balance credit-card statements no
longer import with every row inverted; the account-name matcher prefers an
account's own leaf prefix and gates short-needle containment ("Car" filed
under Cars, not Childcare); quote fetches record the provider-reported
currency in the price source ("Finance::Quote:yahoo (USD)") so the documented
provenance actually exists; latest-quote refresh skips identical same-day
rows (every book open used to append duplicates forever) and all history
fetches share the one-run-at-a-time guard.

**Performance & structure.** The dashboard's alerts/bills/budget reads,
`plannerDebts`, `knownTags`, the price scatter (stable ids), and the cash-flow
forecast (its memo key embedded a live `Date()`, so it never hit) are all
memoised through `cachedReport`; the report screen attaches one `.task` to the
container instead of one per branch (every report computed twice on first
open); free-text search debounces 200 ms (tests call `runSearch()`
directly); `endOfToday()` uses calendar day-arithmetic (the +86 400 form was
wrong on DST transition days) and `todayCap` delegates to it. Shared concepts
now live once: `Account.isWash` (matcher, Uncategorised review, Smart
Categorise), `Book.baseCurrency` (root-commodity-first — `commodities.first`
was registration-order dependent), `BookKvpKeys` (Engine constants for the
cross-module slots), `StatementLabels.uncategorised` (seven comparison sites),
`DividendAccounts` paths, the narrative tokeniser
(`ImportMatcher.narrativeTokens` with an opt-in date-token filter),
`AmountFormat.compact` (the two decks' copies had a symbol hack that printed
"C[redacted]" for CHF), `ReportPeriod.financialYearLabel`, and
`GnuCashDate.parseDayOnly` (CAMT allocated a `DateFormatter` per entry row).
Dead code deleted: `AsyncReport`, `detailLine`/`legDetailLine`,
`debtPlanResults`, `financialYearPackDocuments`, `apiKey`/`setAPIKey`,
`SubaccountsTip`, `Book.removeInvoice`/`noOpenLots`, the `Item.swift` template
husk; `selectedSplitID` is computed from the selection set.

**CI & docs.** The SPDX gate now covers the app-target directories (six files
gained the machine-readable header) and the allowed-to-fail macOS-26 job runs
FeatureUI's tests; plan.md's P6 status, the architecture package graph (Shared
was missing), PRD FR-FIND-01's shared-grammar claim, and deferred.md's rule
tail were corrected to match the code, with two new recorded judgement calls
(rule set-budget, Quick Look for `.gnucash`).

---

## Test comprehensiveness pass (24 Jul 2026)

The closing quality gate: measured line coverage across every package
(merged best-of per suite), then filled the gaps that mattered — and fixed
the five real bugs the new tests flushed out. **1,065 tests green** (was
835), all suites, both platforms, plus the three env-gated live acceptance
harnesses re-run against the reference book.

**Coverage (lines, before → after, own-suite):**

| Package | Before | After | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Engine | 80.6% | **91.8%** | ≥90% ✓ (was the one breach) |
| Interchange | ~92% merged | higher (Gzip 87%, dates 97%, SX import 93%) | ✓ |
| Persistence 93% · Reports 93% · Rules 99% | — | unchanged | ✓ |
| Quotes providers | patchy | AlphaVantage/Finnhub/Stooq 100%, EODHD/TwelveData 97% | ✓ |
| Intelligence `DocumentText` | 50% | **94%** (deterministic PDF-reflow fixtures) | ✓ |
| FeatureUI logic files | 0–59% | InlineEdit/CSV **100%**, SmartCategorize 96%, Budget 97%, ReportDocuments 95%, ReportBuilders 96% | ✓ |

**Notable new suites:** hand-amortised loan schedules; all recurrence
weekend-adjust branches with hand-verified calendar dates; the smart
categoriser's plan/ambiguity/threshold behaviours pinned (its tuned
constants finally have committed guardrails); a **synthetic report-catalogue
sweep** — the CI-runnable counterpart of the env-gated live catalogue, so the
report builders are no longer CI-dark; check-repair scenarios; CSV export
wire format; PDF text-reflow with scrambled content-stream fixtures; widget
snapshot wire format.

**Bugs found by the pass, fixed and pinned:**
1. **`goalEligibleAccounts` always empty** — `AccountNode.typeName` is
   capitalized ("Bank") but three call sites compared it to the lowercase
   `AccountType.rawValue`, so the **Add Goal button was permanently
   disabled**, the invoice funding-account picker was empty, and Time &
   Mileage's income pickers were empty. One case-insensitive
   `AccountNode.isType(…)` helper now serves all three.
2. **`Recurrence.occurrences` skipped weekend adjustment for the first
   occurrence** — the list disagreed with `next(after:)` for a
   weekend-anchored start; the seed is now adjusted like every other
   occurrence.
3. **Alpha Vantage's unknown-symbol answer** (`{"Global Quote": {}}`) threw
   a raw `DecodingError` instead of `QuoteError.noData`.
4. **`"500 IDR"` parsed as −500** — the amount parser's debit marker matched
   any `DR` suffix, including currency codes; it now requires a standalone
   token.
5. **`LoanCalculator.totalInterest` returned −principal** on a zero-length
   term; now 0.

One expectation corrected on my side of the audit: weekend adjustment on
*weekly* recurrences is deliberately discarded (month-anchored semantics,
GnuCash-faithful) — pinned with a comment rather than "fixed".

Deliberately not chased: SwiftUI view bodies (not unit-testable), live-HTTP
transport, FoundationModels session paths (the `LiveModelTests` suite covers
them on-device), and Keychain-backed key storage.

## Deferred-backlog pass (24 Jul 2026)

A sweep of [deferred.md](deferred.md) implementing everything buildable
without external dependencies (runners, NAS hardware, translators stay
blocked; TXF and bank sync stay skipped by decision). Five items closed:

- **GnuCash credit notes (FR-BUS-01).** `Invoice.isCreditNote`, faithful to
  the GnuCash source: the `credit-note` int64 in `<invoice:slots>` is lifted
  on import and always written on export; posting flips every leg's sign
  (`is_cust_doc != is_cn` — the A/R leg carries action "Credit Note"); a book
  holding credit notes exports the **"Credit Notes" book feature** so pre-2.5
  GnuCash refuses rather than misreads. Persistence migration, editor toggle,
  list/detail badges, printable title (AU "ADJUSTMENT NOTE" in the
  tax-invoice layout). The production review's sign-inversion defect is gone.
- **Round-trip fidelity tail (FR-XIO-01).** `InvoiceEntry.entered` is now a
  real field (imported, exported, persisted — no longer re-derived from
  `entry:date`), and `KvpValue` distinguishes `.timespec` from `.date`, so a
  timespec slot at exactly midnight re-exports as a timespec. Both pinned by
  round-trip tests.
- **Load-time warnings (NFR-05).** The SQLite load path still opens
  what it can, but counts every silent default (`LoadWarnings`, task-local,
  threaded through `parseDecimal`/`parseKvp`/`decodeAddress`/GUID fallbacks)
  and the app surfaces a toast on open: "Opened with 2 amounts, 1 identifier
  unreadable and defaulted…". Exercised by a corruption test.
- **iOS book rename/move.** The welcome screen's recents now carry a context
  menu — Rename (in place, audit-log sidecar moved along, Recents and
  bookmarks updated), Move (the system `fileMover`), Remove from Recents.
  Works on macOS too.
- **Rule link-to-bill (FR-RULE-01).** A new `linkToBill` rule action stamps
  matched payments with the schedule's GUID (`finvestlens/bill-id`, an
  ordinary exportable slot); bill reminders check the link **before** the
  description heuristic, so a bill whose payment descriptions vary still
  clears exactly. Editor picker, summary text, and apply-to-history support
  included. (convert-type remains skipped — fuzzy in a double-entry model.)

835 tests green across the six packages (Engine 183, Interchange 81,
Persistence 33, Rules 10, Reports 116, FeatureUI 412); both platforms build.

## Report consistency pass (24 Jul 2026)

A full review of every report surface against the annual-report standard the
Jul 2026 redesign set, closing the "internals migrate to the document
scaffold later" tail. The audit matrix covered headers, amount formatting,
period controls, export, empty states, charts, and typography across all 23
report kinds plus the decks, FY pack, and passport. What changed:

- **One masthead everywhere.** The shared `ReportMasthead` (entity · serif
  title · period · units line, centred — the statement standard) now heads
  the document scaffold (so every scaffold report incl. the six business
  documents), and the two interactive tools. PDF exports carry the same
  masthead: `PrintableStatement` gained the entity line and serif title.
- **Five legacy views migrated onto the scaffold** — Transactions,
  Reconciliation, Portfolio, Investment Lots, Capital Gains now render as
  `ReportDocument`s (their print builders were already the source of truth),
  which gives them the masthead, KPI callouts, ruled tables, notes, PDF
  **and Share** for free. Period control is now uniformly the parameter
  bar's `PeriodSelector` (as-of kinds read the period end); Transactions and
  Reconciliation gained a single-account picker there (defaulting to the
  selected register account), and the investment kinds host the cost-basis /
  fee pickers in the same bar. ~550 lines of one-off view code deleted.
- **Two tools remain interactive by design** — the Forecast (what-if editor)
  and Price History (explorer) — but now open with the masthead, share the
  palette, and export branded PDFs. `CashFlowView` was renamed
  `ForecastView` (it renders the `.forecast` kind; the `.cashFlow` document
  is a different report).
- **Spending Insights joined the scaffold** with a new `summary` block
  (plain-language sentences between callouts and tables, also in the PDF) —
  it had been the one report with no export at all.
- **Portfolio gained an allocation donut** in the document (top holdings,
  tail rolled into "Other"), and every multi-series chart (both allocation
  donuts, the price scatter) now draws from one `ReportPalette` anchored on
  the accent colour instead of SwiftUI's default rainbow. The forecast's
  what-if markers moved from orange to a reserved purple.
- **Real empty states.** A scaffold kind that builds nothing (or an empty
  document) shows a `ContentUnavailableView` with a kind-specific reason —
  previously an infinite "Preparing…" spinner.
- **Share everywhere.** The report screen's toolbar now offers Share beside
  PDF for statements (new `ShareableStatementPDF`) and scaffold documents
  alike; previously only the legacy views could share.
- The dead **Compare stepper** (gated on a hardcoded-false flag) was
  removed; the passport page now honours the app's text-size preference
  (`scaledFont` throughout); the reconciliation integrity note lost its
  debug-ish "Please report this" phrasing.

Verified by `LiveReportCatalogueTests` on the real book: all 17 scaffold
kinds build under their default configurations — 11 content-bearing kinds
asserted non-empty (sections/KPIs/charts counted), business documents build,
price history prints, and the forecast's empty state is exercised. 412
FeatureUI tests green; both platforms build.

## P9 — Planning & insights (24 Jul 2026)

The final phase: Microsoft Money's flagship planning layer plus the
Frollo-inspired wellness pieces, over the GnuCash-rigour engine. Design and
models in [planning-design.md](planning-design.md); the governing rules were
**transparent, adjustable, deterministic, and never advice** — every surface
carries the estimate disclaimer, every assumption is on screen, and every
number traces to the book.

- **Calculators** (`FinvestLensReports`, pure and fixture-tested): `DebtPlan`
  (monthly avalanche/snowball simulation, rolling payments, underwater
  detection, minimums-only baseline), `LifetimeProjection` (annual five-bucket
  model — cash/investments/retirement/property/debts — with life events,
  bracket-estimated tax while working, ordered drawdown in retirement, and a
  book-seeding walk that classifies accounts by type with retirement detected
  by name), `TaxEstimate` (progressive brackets as **editable data** seeded
  with AU resident rates per FY incl. the 2026 cut, flat levy, CGT discount,
  franking/withholding credits), `SpendingInsights` (period-vs-prior category
  joins bound to the pie/bar breakdown, deterministic template sentences),
  `WellbeingScore` (four 0–25 components with exposed arithmetic).
- **Book layer** (`AppModel+Planning`): five new KVP collections (debt plan,
  lifetime plan, tax settings, challenges, emergency records) on the standard
  reload/persist/commit pattern; classification heuristics (retirement roots,
  franking/PAYG names, mortgage exclusion) kept visible on the screens they
  feed.
- **UI**: a **Planner** sidebar destination (Debt Reduction / Lifetime / Tax
  Estimate segments); **Spending Insights** as a report kind in the gallery,
  menu, and favourites machinery; a **Wellbeing** dashboard tile with the
  full working one click away; the **Financial Summary (passport)** as a
  Present-section card and Reports-menu item (A4 PDF, statement typography);
  **savings challenges** in the Goals screen (paced ahead/on-track/behind
  against the straight line, context-menu delete); **Emergency Records** as a
  Records destination behind an optional local-authentication gate (view
  gate, honestly labelled); **Audit Log** viewer in the Book menu.
- **Audit log**: `<book>.audit.log` sidecar written on the same code path as
  undo registration (all five scoped-`editing` tiers), undo/redo replays
  labelled, 1 MB rotation, never inside the book file.
- **Skipped**: TXF export (US-specific; meaningless for an AU book —
  [deferred.md](deferred.md) §5). The `tax-US` code slot still round-trips.

Verified: 636 tests green across Reports/Interchange/FeatureUI (24 new for
P9), and the plan's exit criteria on the **real book** (`LivePlanningTests`):
bucket seeding put the SMSF's [redacted] in retirement with cash/investments/
property/debts populated, a 51-year lifetime projection ran from seeded
defaults, the live credit card produced a five-month payoff plan, the tax
estimate flowed tagged accounts through the FY 2026–27 brackets
([redacted] taxable → [redacted] base + levy), insights produced grounded
sentences, wellbeing read [redacted], and the passport assembled a [redacted] net
worth over six asset classes.

## P8 — Extended statement import: MT940/MT942 + CAMT.053 (24 Jul 2026)

The last planned import formats (`FR-XIO-04`), closing phase P8 (online bank
sync having been skipped by decision the same day — [deferred.md](deferred.md)
§5). Both are native parsers in `Interchange`, feeding `StagedTransaction`
rows into the same Import Matcher as CSV/QIF/OFX:

- **`MT940Importer`** — SWIFT MT940 customer statements *and* MT942 interim
  reports through one tag-line scanner: `{…}` block markers and headers
  ignored, continuation lines folded into their field, transactions read from
  `:61:` statement lines (value date, optional entry date, `D`/`C`/`RD`/`RC`
  marks with reversal sign-flips, optional funds code, comma-decimal amount,
  transaction type, customer reference vs `//bank reference` — the bank ref
  preferred, `NONREF` dropped). The `:86:` narrative joins its lines into the
  memo; German-convention `?nn` subfields are recognised (`?32`/`?33` →
  payee, `?20`–`?29` → remittance memo). Fixtures follow the SWIFT spec and
  published bank samples (ABN AMRO / ING / Danske style).
- **`CAMTImporter`** — ISO 20022 CAMT.053 (and structurally-identical
  CAMT.052) via a streaming `XMLParser`: one row per `<Ntry>` — amount signed
  by `CdtDbtInd` and flipped by a true `RvslInd`, `PDNG` entries skipped
  (they re-arrive booked), booking date preferred over value date, reference
  chosen entry-`AcctSvcrRef` → detail `AcctSvcrRef` → `TxId` → meaningful
  `EndToEndId`, the counterparty (creditor on debits, debtor on credits, both
  `<Nm>` and the newer `<Pty><Nm>` nesting) as payee, unstructured remittance
  lines joined as the memo. Namespace prefixes are tolerated; batched entries
  stay one row at the entry amount, as booked.
- **Detection** — `BankFileFormat` gains `mt940`/`camt` with extensions
  (`.sta`/`.mt940`/`.940`/`.942`/`.fin`, `.camt`/`.c52`/`.c53`/`.c54`) and
  `detect(_:extension:)` content sniffing for ambiguous `.xml`/`.txt`
  (CAMT root/namespace, OFX header, `:20:`+`:25:` tags, QIF `!Type:`), used
  by the bank-file open flow; the review sheet and matcher are unchanged.

Exit criterion verified in `MT940CAMTTests`: an MT940 and a CAMT.053 imported
through `ImportMatcher.match` against a book with history — same-FITID rows
dedupe via `online_id`, new rows pass the mismatch veto, and payee history
assigns the destination account. 78 Interchange tests green.

## Import matcher — transfer completion & real-statement validation (24 Jul 2026)

The QIF/OFX import pipeline was exercised end-to-end against **four real bank
exports** (an ANZ credit-card OFX v2, a CBA a card account OFX v1/SGML, and two Macquarie
QIFs) on a copy of the reference book, with the requirement that transfers
between the user's own accounts come out as **one transaction with a leg in
each account** — in whatever order the statements are imported. What that
surfaced, and what was built:

- **Two-digit QIF years** — `D30/06/26` parsed as year 26 AD (the `yyyy`
  pattern happily reads "26"). `QIFImporter` now carries `yy` twins for every
  slash format and rejects implausible years so the right pattern gets its
  turn, preserving the file-wide day-first/month-first orientation choice.
- **Cross-account transfer completion ("healing")** — when the counterpart
  statement was imported first and its unmatched side sits in a wash account
  (`Imbalance-*`/`Orphan-*`/`Unspecified`/`Uncategorised`), the matcher
  detects the opposite-amount leg in the other real account (same currency,
  ±4 days) and the import **re-points the wash leg** at the target account
  instead of posting a mirror-image duplicate. A **narrative-agreement gate**
  (shared significant tokens — AU banks put the entity name in both sides'
  narratives) stops coincidental equal amounts from pairing. Rules and
  heuristics never override a detected transfer.
- **FITID-mismatch veto** — an amount+date match against a split whose
  `online_id` differs from the row's FITID is refused: a bank never re-issues
  an event under a new id. This killed every false boundary flag on the OFX
  side (last statement's entries vs this statement's new rows).
- **One-to-one claiming** — each existing split (and each pending wash leg)
  absorbs at most one row per batch, so four identical recurring transfers
  against two book entries import the two genuinely new ones (GnuCash's
  matcher claims matches the same way).
- **Statement dates are exact** — user fact (24 Jul 2026): a **daily payment
  limit** chunks a large movement into identical amounts on consecutive days,
  so near-day amount equality between statement-sourced entries is
  coincidence, not identity. Consequences: a **wash-parked book half matches
  a row on the same calendar day only** (its date IS the bank's posting
  date); **transfer healing pairs same-day only** (banks post both sides the
  same day — every historical transfer in the reference book confirms); and
  duplicate matching tries **same-day candidates before the ±window**, so
  identical recurring amounts pair with their own day instead of an earlier
  row greedily claiming a neighbour's leg and starving the last row. The
  ±4-day window survives solely for its real purpose: a hand-entered
  transaction (which has a real destination, not a wash leg) drifting from
  its bank posting date.
- **Wash-half demotion** — a "duplicate" whose counter-legs all sit in wash
  accounts is itself just an unfinished half; completing a pending transfer
  outranks matching it.
- **Reference stamping** — skipped duplicates get the incoming FITID written
  to the matched split's `online_id` (GnuCash's convention), so the next
  re-import matches definitively; healed legs are stamped the same way.
- **Payee history from memos** — destination suggestion now also learns from
  money-leg memos (where renames park the raw narrative), raw-to-raw like the
  smart categoriser; the substring fallback is deterministic (was
  dictionary-order). Cleaned descriptions preserve the raw narrative in the
  money leg's memo so self-learning survives `cleanMerchant`.
- **Credit-card funding fallback** — a positive "PAYMENT - THANK YOU" row on a
  credit account suggests the bank account most often behind recent deposits
  (2-year window), so the first-imported side of a card payment posts as a
  proper transfer.
- **Imbalance fallback** — rows nothing categorised can post to the book's
  existing `Imbalance-<CUR>` account (toggle, default on) instead of silently
  not importing, feeding the Uncategorised sweep; the review list shows a
  **transfer** badge alongside the duplicate badge.

Verified by `LiveBankImportTests` (env-gated on `FL_PERF_FILE` +
`FL_IMPORT_DIR`): both import orders on copies of the real book — parse counts
(220/58/39/3), all dates in-window, the two card payments (8 Jun, 11 May) and
the SMSF internal transfer (20 May) each land exactly once with clean legs,
**zero false duplicates on the reference-less QIF side** (asserted: CMA.qif
flags nothing, and the boundary window holds exactly six [redacted] legs per
side — the book's two April transfers plus all four daily-limit May chunks,
nothing absorbed, nothing doubled), re-importing all four files is a no-op,
and the run reports per-file coverage (e.g. VISA: 142/220 auto-categorised,
78 to Imbalance for review). The only flags left are true duplicates: each
card payment seen from its second statement, and a transfer row whose
transaction the counterpart import had already completed. One chunk pair that
posted across a weekend (a card account debit Sat 2 May, CMA credit Mon 4 May) stays as
two wash-parked halves rather than guessing a cross-day pairing — totals
correct, linkable in review.

## Report redesign — annual-report statements & review decks (24 Jul 2026)

The statement reports moved from working-paper presentation to
**annual-report standard**, and the results gained two **presentation
decks**. Research, judgement rules, and status live in
[report-redesign.md](report-redesign.md); the design decision is
[architecture.md §5.6a](architecture.md) (ADR-6a: presentation arranges,
never computes). The brief's example — `Income:Distributions:VGAD:
Distribution` on the face of a statement — now reads as **VGAD** under a
**Distributions** caption, with fund detail in a note that ties back.

**The statement layer** (`Statements.swift`). `StatementBuilder` projects
the engine's verified flat lines onto the user's own account tree and
applies researched judgement rules (IAS 1 face-vs-notes; AICPA/ASC 274
personal-statement presentation): top-level groups become face captions;
single-child chains collapse (never a colon path — a generic leaf like
"Distribution" loses its name to the specific parent); captions with ≤ 3
postings-bearing accounts inline their children on the face; captions
under 2% of their section fold into "Other" with a note — but cash and
equivalents (IAS 1 minimum line item) and Uncategorised (an integrity
signal) never fold; assets order by liquidity with positives leading and
integrity balances last, liabilities by maturity, income/expenses by
magnitude; every note's total ties to its face line. Statement titles use
the personal-statements vocabulary: **Statement of Financial Position**
(assets − liabilities = net worth on the face; the equity view moves to a
Composition-of-net-worth note), **Income Statement**, **Statement of
Changes in Net Worth** (opening + surplus + valuation movement = closing,
the valuation term derived and footnoted). Prior-year comparative columns
appear when the book reaches back.

A finding on the reference book: the face's net worth ([redacted]) and
the equity view ([redacted]) differ by ~[redacted] — real multi-currency
translation (income converted at posting-date rates, assets at current
rates; GnuCash behaves identically). The composition note now reconciles
it with a **"Currency translation and valuation differences"** line, as an
annual report's translation reserve would — explained on the page instead
of silently disagreeing.

**Rendering** (`StatementView.swift`). Centred masthead (entity, serif
title, period, units line), a Note reference column, right-aligned tabular
figures with **negatives in parentheses** and the currency symbol on first
figures and totals only, a single rule above subtotals, a **double rule**
under closing figures, then *Notes to the financial statements* (Note 1 is
always Basis of preparation). One `StatementSheet` serves screen and PDF.
The **Trial Balance** joined the same treatment: Debit/Credit columns, one
section per category in class order, caption rows with note detail, the
unrealised valuation adjustment on its own Adjustments line (credit side,
as the engine defines it), and a double-ruled grand total stating the
report's point — the books balance. The **Financial Year Pack** now opens
with the three statements (Changes in Net Worth joined it) ahead of
capital gains and dividends & franking; statement kinds dropped the
Compare stepper (they carry their own prior-year column).

**The review decks.** Two 16:9 slide decks in the Reports gallery's
*Present* section (and Reports menu), sharing one machinery (`ReviewSlide`,
`SlideCard`, paging with arrow keys, landscape PDF via a new
`ReportExport.pdfPage`): the **Financial Review** (highlights with a
net-worth line; the net-worth **waterfall bridge** opening → income →
expenses → valuation & FX → closing; income and spending analysis using
the statement layer's own captions with prior-year markers; monthly cash
flow; portfolio; dividends & franking; capital gains; financial position
with debt-to-assets and months of cash cover) and the **Investment
Review**, built from web research into fund factsheets and brokerage
performance summaries (overview with total return on money in; allocation
with the concentration read — holdings count, largest, top-five share;
mark-to-market winners and losers; income with franking and yield on
value; realised gains split at the one-year CGT-discount boundary; and a
return decomposition — income + realised + unrealised over money in,
GnuCash's own model). Slides are content-gated (the dashboard's
has-content rule); every slide carries a deterministic action title; no
new arithmetic anywhere — every figure comes from the existing verified,
memoised computations.

**The guardrail earned its keep immediately.** On the first live run the
on-device narrator's insight claimed "a 2.3% increase in income and a 1.4%
decrease in expenses" — numbers it invented. The response: every slide's
facts pack gained grounded deltas (opening/closing/change/percent, prior
totals, savings rate), the prompt now forbids deriving numbers, and a new
deterministic **`ReviewStoryValidator`** disposes — every numeric token in
a story must round-match a listed figure (raw or k/m-scaled), a listed
delta percent, a label numeral, or a calendar year, or the story is
rejected and the deterministic title stands. The exact live failure is
pinned as a test's reject case. Stories cache per (slide, book revision).

Verified: 399 tests / 83 suites (statement identities incl. trial-balance
column conservation; deck gating on cash-only vs dividend vs securities
books; bridge and decomposition reconciliation against engine totals; the
validator's accept/reject cases), both platform builds, and screenshots on
the reference book — the Statement of Financial Position face and notes,
the Trial Balance, and deck slides ("Portfolio of [redacted] returning 63.2%
on money in"; "33 holdings; the top five are 28.6% of the portfolio").

## Usability & performance redesign (24 Jul 2026)

Four audit passes — usability (persona "Chris" + a periodic/monthly/EOFY
journey walked through twelve use cases), functionality (every public
`AppModel` function swept for UI callers; hidden features, dead code and
duplicates registered), performance (per-render full-book scans traced;
progress-feedback inventory), and session/resilience/accessibility/platform —
produced findings F1–F22, redesign decisions RD1–RD4 (taken with the GnuCash-
familiarity constraint deliberately dropped), and perf items P1–P10. The
working documents are [usability-review.md](usability-review.md) and
[performance-review.md](performance-review.md) (their §7 status notes record
the accepted deviations). Executed as four phases, each committed green:

**Phase 0 — consolidation.** One account-chooser family (`AccountSearch` is the
single matching algorithm; every raw `Picker` site converted to
`AccountField`/`AccountPickerButton`); dead code deleted with tests migrated to
successor APIs; misplaced shared views extracted (`SharedComponents`,
`LinkToTransactionSheet`); a single exchange-rate API; a
`Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier` guard in `publishWidgetData` that stopped
WidgetKit/UNUserNotificationCenter NSExceptions from killing test processes.

**Phase 0.5 — performance quick wins.** The register status strip became a
snapshot folded into `refreshRegister`'s existing row pass (was three
full-book `balance` scans per SwiftUI body pass — P1), pinned by fold tests
(voided, frozen, filter-independence) alongside the engine-parity test.
QuickFill reads a per-revision recency list (was a 46k-transaction sort per
keystroke — P2). `postableAccounts` is cached with the account tree (was a
per-body-pass flatten × every picker cell — P4). **Scoped undo** grew two
tiers (P9): `editingPrices` (array snapshot) and `editingBookKvp` (frame
snapshot + collection reload, so undo can't be re-persisted away) — price
fetches, rate edits, price import, and every settings/collection commit no
longer pay the whole-book XML export (~6.6s on the reference book) per edit;
structural/business ops stay whole-book. An `os_signpost` + DEBUG over-budget
`Perf` harness wraps tree/register rebuilds, search replay, report builds and
whole-book snapshots.

**Phase 1 — structural UI.** **RD1, one register:** the account register is a
single expandable-splits table (selection opens legs inline; **Show All
Splits** expands everything — new `expandAll` row path + test); the
Basic/Auto-Split/Journal switcher is deleted; the whole-book journal is the
sidebar's **All Transactions**. Register controls moved to the window toolbar
(View ▾ · Sort ▾ · Filter · Reconcile · Edit); the window toolbar pins
[+ New ▾][⬇ Import ▾] leading so nothing hides behind » (F1); Saved Searches
folded into the search field's suggestions. **RD2, plain language** (strings
only): Repair Book · Close Financial Year · Group · Show Details ·
All Transactions · Out of balance. **RD4, entry without ceremony:** ⌘N focuses
the entry bar (⇧⌘N full editor, ⌥⌘N New Book), whose prompt says so;
QuickFill completes inline as ghost text — Tab accepts and fills transfer +
amount. Dashboard gained the **Up Next** card (F9): live rows for stale
prices, uncategorised count, stalest reconcile, and this month's statement
import, each with its action button, computed once per (revision, day).

**Phase 2 — journey accelerators.** **RD3, reconcile reimagined:** auto-clear
runs the moment a session starts ("matched N of M — review the rest" as an
inline status, not an alert); the difference remaining is the headline; rows
still needing eyes sort first and stay put while ticking (ordering test);
Finish explains itself while disabled. **One-click prices** (6.4):
`updateAllPrices()` from Book ▸ Update Prices (⌘⇧U), the Up Next card, or the
Prices toolbar, with determinate progress and a completion toast; Prices &
Quotes became the two-tab **Prices & Securities** destination (the buried
securities manager — watchlist, price targets, rename, refetch — is a
first-class tab; the Alerts card deep-links to it; the navigation subtitle
shows last-updated). **Status overlay** (6.8): one bottom-of-window surface
for progress chips, Saving…, and completion/failure toasts; quote fetches,
price updates, saves (P10: `saveWithStatus`, also used by autosave), attach
failures (F20 — previously silent `try?`s) and Revert route through it.
**Session restoration** (F18): sidebar destination incl. selected account
(per book) and dashboard period survive relaunch. **Async reports** (P3): the
heavy reports (portfolio, capital gains, lots, transactions, reconciliation)
memoise per (parameters, revision) and build behind a "Building…" placeholder
via `AsyncReport`; forecast and close-preview memoised likewise; the
categoriser sheet yields before its corpus scan so its spinner paints (P6).
Reports gained a **Recents** row (F12); a dedicated **Reports menu** with
direct jumps; ⌘⇧M Match Attachments; ⌥⌘1/2/3 destination jumps; the
attachments panel cross-links All Linked Documents (6.7).

**Phase 3 — depth.** **Financial Year Pack** (6.6b): pick a financial year
(current + three back, bounded by the book), preview the bundle, export one
PDF — Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Capital Gains, and a new **Dividends &
Franking** summary classifying income per security into franked / unfranked /
imputation credits from the Dividends account tree with a grossed-up total
(classification pinned by tests against the app's own dividend booking
shape). Dashboard **Customise** menu shows/hides panels (F10); the Goals card
surfaces the earmarking maths (total set aside; what's left unallocated —
or over-allocation, in orange — when one account funds the goals). Sweeps:
Escape closes every sheet (F19); icon-only buttons carry accessibility labels
(F21); iPad parity (F22 — web links via `openURL`, Link File… via
`fileImporter`, honest messaging where a macOS-only affordance is absent);
the register's empty state offers "Add a Transaction (⌘N)".

**The dashboard became a board, not a page (F8, user-clarified).** The first
fix (a soft scroll-edge fade) misread the finding: the requirement is that
the dashboard **never scrolls** — the priority list exists to decide what
earns the screen. The masonry `ScrollView` is gone; the dashboard deals a
fixed tile board — columns from the window width, unit rows from its height
(row height stretched so the board lands flush on the bottom edge), panels
placed in priority order into the emptiest fitting column, and anything that
doesn't fit dropped. Panels are **content-aware** (a card whose whole message
is "nothing in this period" yields its tile — Alerts keeps one unit for
"nothing needs attention"); leftover rows stretch the column's last tile;
charts stretch into their tiles; list cards cap rows with "+N more"; Recent
Activity sizes its row count from the tile it was dealt. Verified by
screenshot at full-screen (six information-dense tiles, flush) and 1150×760
(top four cards, flush): no scrolling, no clipping, live re-deal on resize.

**Accepted deviations** (recorded in the review docs' §7 status notes, and in
§10 of [architecture.md](architecture.md)): reports build after first paint
but **on the main actor** — the non-`Sendable` `Book` makes a background read
a race; going further needs a read-gate (writers wait on readers), deferred
until the memoised first-build is shown too slow in practice. Incremental
tree/journal rebuilds (P5.4/P7) stay unbuilt until the signpost harness
produces numbers demanding them.

Verified at each phase: the FeatureUI suite (386 tests / 81 suites at
completion) plus both platform builds (macOS + iOS simulator); the app was
relaunched on the reference book after every phase, with the toolbar, board
and reconcile changes confirmed by screenshot.

## Deferred-backlog closeout (18 Jul 2026)

Resolved a batch of open P0–P7 items from deferred.md, each with tests and a
GnuCash-source reference where relevant:

- **CSV export** (FR-XIO-06) — `CSVExporter` for the account tree, transactions
  (one row per split, GnuCash's "full" layout) and prices; columns mirror
  GnuCash's `csv-tree-export` / `csv-transactions-export`. File ▸ Export CSV.
- **CSV price import** (FR-XIO-03) — `CSVPriceImporter` (explicit mapping or
  header autodetection); `AppModel.importPrices` resolves symbols against the
  book's commodities. Import CSV in the Prices panel.
- **Import GnuCash scheduled transactions + budgets** (FR-IMP-03/04) — a
  second-pass parser (`GnuCashScheduledBudgetImport`) maps `<gnc:schedxaction>`
  (recurrence, template splits via the sched-xaction slot) and `<gnc:budget>`
  (per-period amounts) into the `finvestlens/*` KVP slots the app reads.
  Verified against the real Ashley Bears book (2 SX + 1 budget); live
  round-trip stays byte-clean.
- **Twelve Data + Stooq quote providers** (FR-INV-03b) — one keyed JSON, one
  keyless CSV fallback; surfaced via `QuoteProviderKind.allCases`.
- **Re-open a finished reconciliation** (FR-REC-03) — reverts the last
  statement's reconciled splits to cleared.
- **Manual attach-a-file** (FR-REG-10) — Transaction ▸ Attach File… over the
  existing `assoc_uri` document-link machinery.
- **Open Read-Only on a live lock** (FR-DAT-06) — `openReadOnly` reads without
  taking the lock; edits refused at the `editing`/`editingWholeBook`
  chokepoints; save throws. Offered on the locked-open alert.
- **Autosave-interval setting** (FR-DAT-10) — Off/1/5/10/15 min in a new General
  settings tab; the loop re-reads it live.
- **Free-text search operators** (FR-FIND-01) — `from:`/`to:` (incl. relative
  `-7d`/`-2w`/`-3m`/`-1y`), `type:`, `category:`, `has:`, and `-` negation added
  to the token grammar.
- **Window/state restoration** — reopen the last book on launch (General
  setting).
- **Help menu** — a FinvestLens Help item (⌘?) opening an in-app
  getting-started + search-grammar + keyboard-shortcut reference.
- **CSV import mapping profiles** (FR-XIO-08) — named column-mapping profiles
  (Load / Save as Profile… / Delete) persisted app-wide for repeat imports.
- **Rules: `account` trigger + set-tags / set-description actions**
  (FR-RULE-01, partial) — engine + apply-to-history + editor UI; convert-type /
  link-to-bill / allocate-to-goal still need bill/goal infra.
- **Advanced Portfolio: Money In / Money Out / Income / rate-of-return columns**
  (FR-RPT-02) — from the lot engine's proceeds/cost-basis, plus an **Income**
  column: cash dividends/interest attributed by summing income-account splits in
  every transaction that touches the security account (GnuCash's
  `advanced-portfolio.scm` money-in model), FX-converted on the posting date and
  deduped per transaction. Income folds into total return over money-in.
- **Scheduled-split formulas with variables** (FR-SCH-02) — a `ScheduledSplit`
  can carry a GnuCash credit/debit **formula** (e.g. `interest`, `pay - interest`)
  instead of a fixed amount; `AmountExpression` evaluates it against named
  variables prompted at post time. Imported from GnuCash's SX formula slots and
  surfaced in the Add-Scheduled sheet + the Enter-Due-Transactions prompt.
- **QIF splits + investment actions, OFX investment statements** (FR-XIO-01/02) —
  `StagedTransaction` grew optional `investment` detail and `splits`. The QIF
  parser reads `!Type:Invst` records (action `N`, security `Y`, price `I`,
  quantity `Q`, commission `O`) and `S`/`E`/`$` split legs; the OFX parser reads
  `<BUYSTOCK>`/`<SELLSTOCK>`/`<BUYMF>`/`<SELLMF>`/`<INCOME>`/`<REINVEST>` blocks.
  The importer routes investment rows to the Stock Assistant — the review sheet
  matches each to a security account, picks a settlement (and dividend income)
  account, and creates the stock transaction — while split cash rows post one leg
  per category. Investment rows never reach the cash matcher.
- **Billable time & mileage** (FR-PLAN-14) — a Business ▸ Time & Mileage panel
  logs hours or distance against a customer (quantity × rate, optional job +
  income account); unbilled entries gather onto a customer invoice (one line
  each, reusing the invoice machinery) and are marked billed. A KVP-backed
  collection (`finvestlens/billableEntries`) that round-trips through save/reload.
- **Legacy reports → PDF export** (FR-RPT-05) — the seven interactive reports
  (Transactions, Reconciliation, Forecast, Portfolio, Investment Lots, Price
  Scatter, Capital Gains) each gain a **PDF** toolbar button that builds a
  printable `ReportDocument` from the report's live data and exports it through
  the same paginated statement path the scaffold reports use. The interactive
  views (with their charts) are kept deliberately; only the PDF surface was the
  actionable gap.
- **Rules: allocate-to-goal action** (FR-RULE-01) — a rule can now earmark a
  matched transaction's amount to a savings goal (`FR-GOAL-01`); Apply-to-History
  previews the allocation and commits the aggregated goal deltas as one change.
  Leaves only convert-type and link-to-bill on the rules-action tail.
- **Smart Import: create a transaction from an unmatched invoice** (FR-AI-07) —
  when an analysed invoice has no matching register transaction, the review row
  now offers *Create Transaction…* with a funding-account picker (bank / cash /
  asset / credit / liability). The new transaction pays the total from that
  account, split across each line item's suggested category (line-sum residual
  posted as an adjustment), and the PDF is linked to it.
- **Savings goals / piggy banks** (FR-GOAL-01) — named targets that earmark part
  of an asset account (Firefly III's piggy banks): target amount + optional date
  + group, add/withdraw money (a read-model, no transaction posted), progress
  bars, and completion. Book-menu Savings Goals panel; stored as one JSON
  collection in a book KVP slot (`finvestlens/savingsGoals`), so each change is
  one undoable whole-book edit and it round-trips through save/reload.
- **Check printing** (FR-REG-11) — Transaction ▸ Print Check… draws a check
  for the selected transaction: the outflow from a bank/cash/asset account sets
  the amount and the account, the description is the payee, and the amount is
  spelled out on the legal line (`AmountInWords`, GnuCash's `numeric_to_words`).
  Rendered in the conventional US personal-check layout and saved as a PDF.
- **Business: Australian Tax Invoice layout** (FR-BUS-03) — a second printable
  layout on the invoice PDF (GnuCash `taxinvoice.scm`): the ATO-required "Tax
  Invoice" title, the seller's **ABN** in the header, a per-line **GST Rate**
  column, GST-labelled totals (Subtotal excl GST / GST / Total inc GST), and the
  "Total price includes GST of $X" statement. Chosen from the invoice's
  Save PDF… menu alongside the standard layout.
- **Business: Vendor / Employee / Job summary reports** (FR-BUS) — three new
  business reports joining Customer Summary + Receivable/Payable Aging, one row
  per party (charged / paid / outstanding over its posted documents, most-charged
  first), the shared shape behind GnuCash's per-owner reports. Book-wide, as-of,
  PDF-exportable through the report scaffold.
- **Loan amortization assistant** (FR-SCH-04) — `LoanCalculator.scheduledPayment`
  builds a GnuCash Mortgage/Loan-style scheduled transaction: fixed payment out
  of the funding account, split into a variable **interest** leg (`FR-SCH-02`
  formula, read from the schedule) and the remaining **principal**. Wired into
  the Loan Calculator view via a "Create Scheduled Payment…" sheet that picks the
  three accounts.
- **CI** (NFR-08) — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: a matrix job builds + tests the
  seven core packages and an SPDX-header gate on every push/PR; the app +
  Intelligence build job is present but `continue-on-error` until a hosted
  macOS-26 / Xcode-26 runner exists.

Every code item above ships with unit tests (or, for the GnuCash SX/budget
import, a real-book verification); each package suite and the full app build
(`CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`) are green. The remaining deferred items are mostly
externally blocked (Apple developer-portal provisioning, real NAS/SMB
hardware, a physical iOS device, human translators) or deliberate
divergences/non-goals — see deferred.md.

## Platform enablement — extension targets & capabilities (18 Jul 2026)

Closed the deferred.md §3 "needs a target / entitlement" gaps: the targets,
entitlements, and feeding code, then **provisioned, signed and verified working**
end-to-end (iCloud, App Group, both extensions) under team *Hello Tham Pty. Ltd.*
(`RPL5R637DS`).

**Bundle-ID change.** `com.hellotham.finvestlens` turned out to be held by an
inaccessible Apple team, so its explicit App ID (which capabilities require)
couldn't be registered — signing failed the moment entitlements were added. The
app's identity moved to `com.hellotham.finvestlensapp` (extensions become
`…finvestlensapp.FinvestLensWidgets` / `.FinvestLensQuickLook`, App Group
`group.com.hellotham.finvestlensapp`, iCloud `iCloud.com.hellotham.finvestlensapp`);
the **`.finvestlens` file extension / document UTI is unchanged**. Provisioning
was staged (app capabilities first, then the two extension targets) to isolate
signing risk. Steps captured in [provisioning.md](provisioning.md).

- **App entitlements** — new `finvestlens.entitlements` (wired via
  `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS` on both app configs): the App Group
  `group.com.hellotham.finvestlensapp` and the iCloud CloudDocuments container
  `iCloud.com.hellotham.finvestlensapp` (FR-PLT-02). `Info.plist` gained
  `NSUbiquitousContainers` so the book surfaces as a "FinvestLens" folder in
  iCloud Drive. App Sandbox stays off (the sibling `.lock` needs it off).
- **FinvestLensShared** — a Foundation-only leaf package: the App Group helper
  (`SharedAppGroup`) + the `WidgetSnapshot` the app publishes for its
  extensions. Deliberately dependency-free so a memory-limited extension links
  it without pulling Engine/GRDB/SwiftUI. Unit-tested.
- **Snapshot pipeline** — `AppModel.publishWidgetData()` builds the snapshot
  from the **live in-memory book** (never re-reading the 56 MB document) on
  save / open / close, writes it to the App Group container, and reloads widget
  timelines. `IntentSupport.snapshot()` does the same out-of-process (for
  intents) by reading the last book.
- **FinvestLensWidgets** — a WidgetKit app-extension target with Net Worth and
  Alerts widgets (small/medium), reading only the snapshot (FR-PLT-03).
- **FinvestLensQuickLook** — a Quick Look preview extension: a
  `QLPreviewingController` that reads the previewed `.finvestlens` file with
  read-only system SQLite3 (no GRDB) and shows headline counts (accounts /
  transactions / commodities / prices) (FR-PLT-03).
- **Local notifications** — `AlertNotificationScheduler` delivers the alerts
  engine as `UNUserNotificationCenter` local notifications (FR-PLAN-05), deduped
  by each alert's stable id, warning/critical only; authorization requested once
  at launch. (Remote/APNs push stays a non-goal — FinvestLens is local-first,
  with no server to originate a push.)

The two extension targets were registered in the modern (objectVersion-77,
synchronized-group) `project.pbxproj` by scripted, cross-referenced insertion;
each step was validated with `plutil -lint` + `xcodebuild -list`, and the app
scheme builds and embeds both `.appex` bundles
(`xcodebuild … CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`). The `FinvestLensShared` package is
`swift build`/`swift test` green.

## Release 1.0 (P0–P6)

The engine, native `.finvestlens` document + locking, GnuCash import/export,
core UX, everyday finance (reconcile / scheduled / budgets / reports / bank
import / rules / search), investments + multi-currency + quotes, and
sync / dashboard / alerts / lock — with undo/redo, save-on-quit, and a full
menu bar after the usability + HIG passes. Shipped 13 July 2026.

## GnuCash round-trip fidelity (14 Jul 2026)

Deep round-trip on a real 8.5 MB book (560 accounts, 46,578 txns, 102,706
prices) is **clean** — full graph + balances identical, double export
byte-identical. Found & fixed: template-transactions ROOT hijacked the book
(orphaning every real account); price/amount precision loss (exporter rounded
to currency SCU; now exact rationals with continued-fraction recovery for FX
cross-rates); book GUID not re-imported. Re-runnable harness:
`FL_ROUNDTRIP_FILE=… swift test --filter LiveFileRoundTripTests`.

**KVP (slot) fidelity.** All slots on book/account/transaction/split are
preserved verbatim through import/export (nested frames, lists, gdate/timespec,
guid, numeric, integer); `notes` is lifted into `Account.notes`/
`Transaction.notes`. Verified on the real book (18,646 notes, 3,944 online_id,
colours, reconcile-info) — round-trip clean including KVP equality.

**Commodity fidelity.** `Commodity` gained `exchangeCode` / `getQuotes` /
`quoteSource` / `quoteTimezone` / `kvp` (identity stays namespace+mnemonic;
backward-compatible Codable + sqlite v2 migration), so `cmdty:xcode`, quote
config, and `cmdty:slots` (`user_symbol`) round-trip. The live harness compares
the export against the **original** file's inventory (slot-key multiset, entity
+ cmdty element counts) — clean on the real book.

**Check & Repair** (offered after import and in the Book menu) removes empty
transactions, houses orphan splits, and posts imbalances — so exports are
cleaner than the source. GnuCash **account colours** render as Finder-tag-style
dots in the sidebar and are editable with a native colour picker.

## GnuCash parity audit — accounts & transactions (15 Jul 2026)

Audited the register and account functions against a real GnuCash 5.x running
the same book, menu by menu. Three **bugs** came out and are fixed
(`EditFidelityTests` pins each; every one was verified to fail with its fix
reverted):

| Bug | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Editing a transaction destroyed share counts and split memos | `EditableSplit` carried only account + amount, so `commit()` rebuilt every split with `quantity: nil` (→ defaults to value) and `memo: ""`. Re-saving an unchanged 100-share/$1,000 buy left **1000 shares**, memo gone. Balance checks can't see it: the *values* still balance. | The editor row carries `quantity`/`memo` through untouched; `asInput` is the single exit point. Verified in the GUI: the 11,600-share AGL buy re-saves with 11,600 shares and Net Worth unmoved. |
| Voided splits still moved the register's running balance | `Book.balance` excludes voided (`Book.matches`), `refreshRegister` did not — so the register's last balance disagreed with the sidebar and every report. | The row still shows with its amount and `v`; it no longer moves the balance. |
| No Unvoid, and the R column silently un-voided | `cycleReconcileState`'s `default` mapped voided → `n`, one split at a time. | `unvoidTransaction`/`isVoided` added (context menu shows Void or Unvoid); the cycle leaves voided **and** frozen alone. |

A note on auditing: five rows of the original gap list were wrong, all
overstating the gap (a hidden-account toggle that existed, an account-tree
filter already written for Find, Journal-style Edit that was present, etc.).
The lesson: a row here is a claim about code and ages like one.

**Data-integrity bug found while auditing (15 Jul 2026):**

| Bug | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Editing a transaction silently un-reconciled it | `updateTransaction` rebuilt every split from `SplitInput`, which carried only account, value, quantity and memo. Everything else came back as a constructor default: `reconcileState` reset to `n`, `reconcileDate`/KVP dropped, `action` lost, the split's guid regenerated. Retyping a description was enough. 34,939 of 46,553 transactions have a reconciled/cleared split, so the status-bar Reconciled balance — [redacted], matching GnuCash to the cent — would have walked down as transactions were edited. The values still balanced, so nothing downstream could see it. | The save re-attaches to the split each row came from, keyed by a `splitID` the row carries; what the editor never showed survives because it is never copied. The save also stopped assigning `dateEntered = datePosted` on every edit. |

**Parity gaps found and since built** (all `done`; verified against GnuCash's
own figures where possible):

- **Structured Find (⌘F)** — GnuCash's Split Search: 14 of 16 criteria, all/any,
  add/remove rows. A criterion tests a *split*, not a transaction; results roll
  up to one row per transaction but keep the matched split. Verified: 5,385
  reconciled a card account splits totalling **[redacted]**, GnuCash's own status-bar
  figure, to the cent. Account picker is a filterable collapsed tree (GnuCash's
  "Select Accounts to Match"); Closing Entries + All Accounts criteria;
  new/refine/add/delete search types replayed as a live pipeline; saved queries
  in book KVP (which GnuCash cannot do).
- **Search results are actionable** — select, Edit-in-place, Show in Register
  (opens the balance-sheet leg, not `Imbalance-*`), and multi-select bulk
  actions (set reconcile state / void / delete, each one edit + one Undo).
- **Find Account (⌘I)** — type, Return; shares the `matching` predicate with Find
  and the sidebar filter. Import Bank File moved to ⌥⌘I.
- **Register Sort By / Filter By** — Sort menu (Standard/Date/Entry/Number/
  Amount/Description/Memo + reverse) and Filter sheet (date range + 5 reconcile
  statuses), mirroring GnuCash's View menu, persisted per account in
  UserDefaults, click-to-sort headers. The balance is computed once in canonical
  order, then filtered, then sorted (both display-only). Verified on a card account
  against GnuCash: identical rows, order and balances (238,358.52 → 294,057.07).
- **Double-line mode** — editor Notes field, per-split memo + action, and View ▸
  Double Line joining notes · memo · action under the description. 18,641/46,553
  transactions carry notes (40%), 10,876 splits a memo, 280 an action.
- **Register ops** — Cut/Copy/Paste (⇧⌘X/C/V), Go to Date (⌘G),
  Schedule-from-transaction, Auto-Split Ledger, a blank entry row at the foot
  (date, description, QuickFill, transfer, signed amount, Return), and editable
  quantity on FX/security legs with the implied rate shown. A Transaction menu
  (Edit ⌘E, Go to Other Account ⌘J, Reconcile State, Duplicate ⌘D, Add
  Reversing, Void/Unvoid, Delete ⌘⌫) via a shared `TransactionActions` view so
  the menu bar and all three context menus can't drift.
- **Account ops** — Cascade Account Properties (opt-in per property), Auto-clear
  (ported from `gnc-autoclear`), Open Subaccounts, the reconcile report; Delete
  Account asks GnuCash's question (where do postings and children go); sidebar
  filter + show-hidden toggle so `isHidden` does something.
- **Data ahead of UI** — Frozen (`f`) reachable via a Reconcile State submenu;
  Rules gained multi-trigger AND/OR, `setNotes`, groups with ordering and
  switches, tag autocomplete from `Book.allTags`. The pattern named: each was
  *implemented and tested* but had no way in, so tests passed while the feature
  did not exist.

## Reports redesign (17 Jul 2026)

The GnuCash reports audit grew into a redesign of the whole surface. The
arithmetic was already good — every report pinned to an identity (trial-balance
columns agree, the equity statement bridges two balance sheets, cash flow's
in − out equals the set's net change) and verified against the reference book —
but the *surface* had five structural problems:

1. **Detached window/modal.** Reports opened in their own window (macOS) / sheet
   (iOS); an analytics surface should live in the detail pane where the data is.
2. **Pregeneration.** Opening Reports immediately computed the default report —
   seconds of work on a 46k-transaction book before the user chose anything.
3. **Recompute-in-`body`.** Reports computed inside SwiftUI `body`, so a
   date-picker interaction recomputed a full-book report per keystroke.
4. **O(accounts × transactions) arithmetic.** Statement reports asked each
   account for its balance and every balance walked the whole book (~26M split
   visits) — the same shape as the `netWorthSeries` bug.
5. **No period vocabulary / configurations / document rendering.** Dates were
   ad-hoc; no financial-year selector, no saved configurations (despite
   FR-RPT-04), and plain `List` rendering that read like another register.

The decisions taken: Reports is an **inline** detail-pane destination (⌘R) with
"Open in New Window" as a secondary command; entering shows a **gallery** and
nothing computes until a report is chosen (`.task(id: configuration)`, never in
`body`); one parameter model (`ReportPeriod` financial-year-aware vocabulary +
Codable `ReportConfiguration` + book-KVP favourites, honouring FR-RPT-04);
**one-pass arithmetic** (`Book.balancesByAccount` gains date bounds); and a
shared **document scaffold** (header, KPI callouts, chart, `Grid` tables with
ruled totals, methodology notes, optional Apple-Intelligence commentary). It
landed across five commits:

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Five new reports | Trial Balance, Equity Statement, Account Summary, Cash Flow with GnuCash semantics (in − out = net change; old projection renamed Forecast), Income & Expense charts. 31 identity tests. |
| One-pass arithmetic | Every statement report walked the book once *per account* (26M split visits). Now one walk per report: accountSummary 15.63s → 0.061s, balanceSheet 7.89s → 0.058s, trialBalance 7.62s → 0.061s, equityStatement 6.77s → 0.129s (debug). Equivalence proven old-vs-new, byte-identical. |
| Period vocabulary + favourites + defaults | `ReportPeriod` named rules resolved against the book's FY start (AUD books default to July); favourites in book KVP, replace-by-name; FY start + default period as book-scoped settings. |
| Inline surface, no pregeneration | Reports live in the detail pane (⌘R); the detached window is an explicit menu item. Nothing computes until a report is chosen; computation runs in a task with a spinner, never in `body`. |
| Document polish + AI notes | Statement reports render through `ReportDocument`: header, KPI callouts, charts, Grid tables with ruled totals, methodology notes, optional on-device commentary (`ReportNarrator`). PDF prints the same value the screen renders. Income Statement FY 2025–26 matches SQL to the cent (233,856.12 / 79,013.41). |
| Commentary live-model check | `ReportNarrator` has a live on-device test (`LiveModelTests.reportCommentary`, ~1s). It surfaced a contract drift (five notes despite a two-to-four guide) — now clamped to four. |
| Average Balance | Daily-weighted average balance per interval (min/max/gain/loss/profit), account-scoped. `FinancialReports.averageBalance` matches GnuCash's chart to zero difference across 15 monthly intervals (4 identity tests). CY 2025 weighted average [redacted] agrees across KPI and table. |
| Multicolumn statements | Period-over-period columns via a **Compare: N** stepper on Balance Sheet and Income Statement (0 = single column). Each column reuses the verified per-period computation; the scaffold gained a generic multi-column table (on screen and in PDF). Income Statement FY 2025–26 vs 2024–25 vs 2023–24 align with blanks where an account had no line. |

## Investment reports parity audit (17 Jul 2026)

Figure-verified Advanced Portfolio / Lots / Capital Gains against GnuCash
5.16's own report engine (`gnucash-cli` on an identical copy; a hand-written
saved-report config aligned the options). **Every real holding matches to the
cent** — shares, basis, value, realised, unrealised, under FIFO and average —
and the FIFO grand totals for basis ([redacted]) and realised gain
([redacted]) matched exactly across ~2,069 disposals spanning 46 years. Total
market value and total gain ([redacted] / [redacted]) match to the cent.

| Item | Notes | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phantom lots after an oversell | An uncovered sale discarded the deficit, so a later buy opened a fresh lot instead of covering the short — four long-exited super accounts showed ≈[redacted] of holdings that don't exist. `CostBasis` now carries the shortfall: covering buys close it (zero proceeds, buy-back cost as basis, dated at the cover) and `remainingQuantity` reflects the true balance. | fixed |
| Brokerage-fee treatment | A `FeeTreatment` option (Ignore / Include in basis) on the cost-basis engine and investment reports, as a **Fees** picker. Include-in-basis matches GnuCash's default: a listed holding to the cent (basis [redacted], realised [redacted]). Default stays **Ignore** (our GnuCash-"ignore"-exact baseline). *Known divergence:* this book books non-fee amounts (imputation credits, capital loss, contributions tax) as expense splits inside managed-fund transactions; GnuCash's money-in/out accounting washes them out over a closed position while our per-parcel engine subtracts them (~[redacted] realised across ~6 accounts). Matching would require adopting GnuCash's money-flow model — deferred (P8), arguably not more correct. | done |
| Average-method rounding | GnuCash rounds each sale's basis progressively; we keep full precision until the report edge — 2¢ drift on one account over 40 years. | wontfix |

## GnuCash report catalogue — build-vs-skip (17 Jul 2026)

Walked GnuCash 5.16's full report menu (65 entries) against our fifteen
`ReportKind`s. Most are already covered, a chart/register variant of something
we have, or business (deferred). **Average Balance** and **multicolumn
statements** were the two genuine net-new analytics — both built (above). The
rest is recorded so "is there parity?" has a written per-report answer:

- **Covered / alias**: Profit & Loss (= Income Statement), Investment Portfolio,
  Net Worth Bar/Line, Income/Expense Chart & Line, Cash Flow, Transaction
  Report, Reconciliation, Balance Forecast, Future Scheduled Summary, single-
  period account pies.
- **Registers cover**: General Journal, General Ledger (our register forms).
- **Marginal variants (skip)**: Cash Flow Barchart, Transaction Breakdown,
  Over-Time charts, Securities, Price.
- **With budget work**: Budget Report chart/statement variants.
- **Tax/business (defer)**: Income & GST Statement, Tax Schedule / TXF Export
  (→ P9 tax tools), IFRS weighted-average cost basis; all invoice/receipt and
  customer/vendor/employee business reports (P7 surfaces below).
- **Novelty/infra (skip)**: Day-of-Week charts, Sample reports/graphs.

## P7 Business features — GnuCash Business menu audit (17 Jul 2026)

Small-business accounting: engine, native persistence, GnuCash-XML round-trip,
and UI are **built and tested**. The reference book has no business objects, so
the engine is verified by accounting identities and GnuCash's documented
arithmetic, cross-checked by round-tripping through GnuCash 5.16.

| GnuCash menu item | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Customer / Vendor / Employee data model | engine + persist | `Business.swift`; SQLite store |
| Job (under customer or vendor) | engine + persist | `Job`, `BusinessOwner.job` |
| New/Find Customer·Vendor·Employee·Job | built | Business hub (⇧⌘B), `BusinessView.swift` |
| New Invoice / Bill / Expense Voucher | built | `InvoiceEditorSheet`, `InvoiceDetailSheet` |
| Post to A/R–A/P (lots + entries) | built | `postInvoice`/`unpostInvoice`; 6 tests |
| Process Payment (apply to invoices) | built | `processPayment` (oldest-first, partial, over-payment → pre-payment lot); 3 tests |
| Sales Tax Table editor | built | `TaxTablesSheet`; `TaxTable`/`TaxTableEntry` |
| Billing Terms editor | built | `BillingTermsSheet`; `BillTerm` |
| Company / business information | built | `CompanyInfo` book-KVP + `CompanyInfoSheet` |
| Receivable/Payable Aging report | built | `aging(forOwner:)`, `agingByOwner(...)`; 2 tests |
| Customer Summary report | built | `ReportKind.customerSummary`; 1 test |
| Printable / Tax Invoice | built | `PrintableInvoice` → PDF; company header + bill-to + lines |
| GnuCash-XML round-trip of business objects | built + tested + GnuCash-verified | owners, addresses, `<act:lots>`, `<split:lot>`, business KVP slots |

**GnuCash 5.16 reads our exported file and attributes postings to their owners**
— Receivable Aging shows Acme $1,450 / Globex $2,200 and Customer Summary shows
Acme $1,500 / Globex $2,000, matching our aging engine to the cent. The earlier
"No Customer" symptom is fixed: GnuCash resolves a posting's owner via a
`gncInvoice` slot **on the transaction** plus `trans-date-due`; `postInvoice`
now writes both on the transaction (regression-tested, confirmed by re-running
GnuCash's own reports).

Business edits are undoable (they ride the whole-book GnuCash-XML snapshot) and
persist through save/reload (SQLite). Remaining P7 tails (in deferred.md): Bills
Due Reminder surface, vendor/employee/job detail reports, Australian-Tax invoice
layout, time & mileage tracking.

## Full GnuCash-source line-by-line audit (17 Jul 2026)

Audited the whole implementation against the real GnuCash C/C++ source (cloned
at `~/Repositories/gnucash-reference`) with a multi-agent sweep over the engine,
XML backend, and import; every confirmed divergence was fixed and every absent
feature implemented.

**Correctness bugs fixed** (each with a test, verified against source):
- **Frozen (`f`) splits** now count in cleared *and* reconciled balances
  (`Account.cpp:2324`) and fold into the reconcile report's reconciled funds.
- **Price lookup**: nearest-in-time (GnuCash's default `pricedb-nearest`), not
  newest-on-or-before; indirect common-currency chaining; `securityUnitValue`
  tries every quote currency; converted balances round-then-sum.
- **Business invoice arithmetic**: per-entry rounding so postings always balance
  (bug 628903); tax-inclusive back-compute; proximo cutoff + real-month clamp.
- **Auto-clear**: skip zero-amount splits; statement-date cutoff.
- **XML round-trip**: `split:reconcile-date`; list-typed KVP bare-value format.
- **Register order**: `xaccTransOrder_num_action` canonical order (numeric
  num/action, then entered/description/guid).
- **Import dedupe**: match on the OFX FITID via the split `online_id` slot
  (GnuCash's definitive match), not just the transaction number.

Stock-transaction shapes (buy/sell/dividend/reinvest/return-of-capital/split)
were audited and already match GnuCash's split structure — no change.

**Absent features implemented** (model + XML round-trip + native store + UI):
- **Amount expression parser** (`gnc-exp-parser`) — `5*3`, `10.50+2`, `(1+2)/3`.
- **SX advance-create / advance-remind days** — create/remind ahead of due.
- **Invoice discount-how** modes — `PRETAX` / `SAMETIME` / `POSTTAX`.
- **Per-period budgets** — `Budget.numPeriods` + `BudgetLine.periodAmounts`,
  unset-period reads as zero, period picker in the editor. New sqlite migrations
  `v3_billterm_cutoff`, `v3_entry_disc_how`.

**Accepted as non-gaps (documented, not fixed):**
- Currency-commodity export emits `cmdty:fraction`/`name` that GnuCash omits for
  ISO currencies. GnuCash reads it without error; round-trip byte-verified.
  Within FR-EXP-02 tolerance.
- `isBalanced` treats a sub-minor-unit residual as balanced (ADR-1 tolerance).
- Price same-date tie-break: GnuCash's is GUID-nondeterministic; ours is the
  deterministic first-inserted — strictly better.

## GnuCash menu parity — Tools / View gaps (18 Jul 2026)

A full audit of every FinvestLens menu against GnuCash's (File → Help), with
GnuCash 5.x open on the same book. The Actions / Tools / View menus (where the
functional verbs live) were read from the running app; the File / Edit /
Reports / Business menus were cross-referenced against the command tree in
`finvestlens/finvestlensApp.swift`. The audit corrected itself (three items
first read as missing — Sort By, Filter By, Go to Date — were already
implemented) and closed five real gaps. Legend: **=** parity · **+** exceeds · **≈** near · **−** gap.

**File** — New/Open/Recent (=), Save/Revert (=), Import (**+**: adds Smart PDF/AI import), Export GnuCash (=), Print via Reports (=), Properties/Settings (=), Close/Quit (=).
**Edit** — Cut/Copy/Paste (=), Find + Find Account (**+**: saved searches, tag search), Edit/Delete Account (=), Preferences/Settings (=), Tax Report Options (=, flags round-trip via `tax-related`/`tax-US`).
**View** — Toolbar/Status Bar (=), **Summary Bar** (=, added by this audit), Basic/Auto-Split/Journal ledger styles (=), Double Line (=), Sort By (=), Filter By (=), Open Subaccounts (=), Refresh (= automatic).
**Transaction** — Enter/Cancel/Duplicate (=), Delete/Void (=), Add Reversing (=), Jump to other account (=), Associate File/`assoc_uri` (=), Cut/Copy/Paste txn (≈ Duplicate covers it).
**Actions** — Transfer (=), Reconcile (=), Auto-clear (≈), Stock Split (=), View Lots (≈ cost-basis report, not a lot editor), Blank Transaction (=), Go to Date (=), Split Transaction (=), Edit Exchange Rate (≈ via Currency Transfer), Scheduled Transactions (=), Budget (**+** rollover/envelope/zero-based), Check & Repair (**+** proposes/previews/one-undo).
**Business** — Customers/Vendors/Employees (=, in the ⇧⌘B hub), Invoices/Bills/Vouchers (=), Receivable/Payable Aging (=).
**Reports** — Assets & Liabilities / Balance Sheet / Net Worth (=), Income & Expense (=), Investment/Portfolio (=), Business Aging + Customer Summary (=), Transaction Report (=), Print/PDF export (=).
**Tools** — Price Database (=), Security Editor (=), General Journal (= register style), Transaction Linked Documents (=, book-wide list), Import Map Editor (≈ our Rules), Close Book (=, Period-End Close), Loan Calculator (=), Online Banking Setup (n/a — bank-file/PDF import by design).
**Windows / Help** — single-window; Reports opens its own window (=); About + onboarding (≈, no bundled manual).

The five gaps closed by the audit:

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Register summary bar | Present / Cleared / Reconciled from the engine's existing `BalanceFilter`, gated off for a mixed-commodity subtree. Matches GnuCash's status strip on a card account to the cent (Present [redacted], Reconciled [redacted]). |
| Linked Documents list (Book menu) | Book-wide roll-up of every `assoc_uri` link, newest first, missing files flagged — the per-transaction link was only reachable one register row at a time. |
| Loan Calculator (Book menu) | Fixed-rate amortisation in the engine (pure `Decimal`), payment + totals + schedule. $300k @ 6% / 30yr → $1,798.65/mo. Totals summed from the schedule so they agree to the cent. |
| Period-End Close (Book menu) | Moves income/expense into equity as of a date, one balanced closing transaction per currency, undoable, with a per-currency preview (AUD and USD shown separately, never blended). |
| Tax Report Options (Edit menu) | Flag income/expense accounts, assign a tax code, see the schedule. Flags stored in GnuCash's exact `tax-related` / `tax-US` slots so they round-trip. |

**Intentionally not built** (rarely relevant to a personal AUD book): Import Map Editor (GnuCash's Bayesian match store — our rules engine serves the purpose), Online Banking Setup (superseded by bank-file/PDF import), and a bundled help manual. **Where FinvestLens exceeds GnuCash:** AI/PDF Smart Import, saved searches and tag search, envelope/zero-based budgets, a previewing Check & Repair with single-action undo, and the home dashboard with alerts.

**Account-scoped undo (18 Jul 2026).** `updateAccount`, `moveAccount`,
`cascadeProperties` and `setAccountTax` went through `editingWholeBook`, which
serialises the whole book (~6.6s / ~115 MB per edit on the reference book).
Added `editingAccounts([ids], named:)` — the account counterpart of the
transaction-scoped `editing` — which snapshots only the named accounts' value
fields (incl. the KVP frame carrying colour and tax slots) plus their tree slot
(parent + sibling index, restored via a new `Account.addChild(_:at:)`). A tax
toggle is now **0.067s, down from ~6.6s (~100×)**; the pre-existing account-undo
tests pass unchanged, plus three new cases (tax flag, cascade subtree,
move-restores-position).

## Apple Intelligence (13 Jul 2026)

Post-1.0 addition of the `Intelligence` package (FR-AI-01…08, Architecture §11):
PDF statement import with light reconciliation, auto-categorisation, invoice
splitting, dividend statements incl. franking credits, budget suggestion, a
forecast outlook, and Smart Import (drop multiple PDFs, each classified and
routed). Applied invoice/dividend PDFs are stored in a configurable document
folder and linked to their transaction GnuCash-style (`assoc_uri`).

Fixed along the way (pre-existing 1.0 bugs uncovered by GUI testing): File-menu
Save/Revert/Import/Export/Close Book were silently missing
(`CommandGroup(after: .saveItem)` has no anchor in a plain WindowGroup —
re-anchored to `.newItem`); bank-file import never presented its picker on macOS
(replaced the unreliable SwiftUI `.fileImporter` with NSOpenPanel, deferred out
of the view-update transaction). The `finvestlens/statement-date` slot rides
through XML export/import so dual-date duplicate detection survives a round-trip.

## Performance work (15 Jul 2026)

All measured against the reference book (46k txns / 102k prices). See
[architecture.md §10](architecture.md#10-derived-state-and-performance) for the
design.

| Was | Now | What |
|---|---|---|
| Opening a book blocked the main thread | isolated to a `DocumentLoader` global actor, returns `sending FinvestLensDocument` | Graph built off the main actor without making `Book` `Sendable`. `open`/`openBook` are `async`; the root view shows "Opening <book>…"; a second click mid-load can't open a second document. |
| `refreshAll` re-sorted every price | 0.158s → 0.041s (release) | `priceRows`/`rateRows` derived on demand behind a cache dropped in `refreshAll()`/`close()`, with a `derivedRevision` counter carrying the observation dependency. |
| `netWorthSeries` = 1.7 billion split visits | 32.329s → 0.066s (~490×, debug) | Rewritten as one pass in date order carrying a running total per account. Still [redacted] to the cent. This *was* the "navigating to the Dashboard blocks" and "main-actor tail of an open" symptoms — an algorithm, not a threading problem. |
| Whole-book undo snapshot per edit | pre-capture, transaction- and account-scoped | Each edit captures only what it changes before changing it; no baseline held between edits, so opening a book pays nothing. Register edit 5.79s → 0.26s; account edit 6.6s → 0.067s. |
| Price lookup scanned 102k prices per call | binary-searched index, invalidated on `prices` change | Preserves the scan's exact tie-breaking (first price of the winning date). |
| `balance(of:)` walked the book per call | `balancesByAccount()` one-pass | Account tree converts each account once and rolls subtree sums up. `refreshAll` 33.7s → 0.25s. |
| Journal / General Ledger unusable on 46k | uniform `JournalRow` in a `Table`, cached | No windowing; jumps to either end instant; ⌘↑ reaches the true oldest. |

Remaining perf note: with prices lazy, the ~0.04s of every `refreshAll()` is
`rebuildAccountTree` + `runSearch`; fast enough to feel instant (subtree-only
rebuild is a P8 option if ever needed).

## Usability review (July 2026)

Resolved: File/Book menu bar (New/Open/Open Recent/Import GnuCash/Export/Close/
Revert + every tool panel with shortcuts), lean toolbar with a Tools menu,
GnuCash import UI (File menu + welcome screen), price-target editor, account
re-parenting, stale-lock Break-Lock recovery, iCloud conflict-version resolution
in the external-change banner, welcome recents.

**iOS documents.** New/Open panels are AppKit on macOS; iOS uses `fileImporter`.
Verified in the simulator: welcome → Open… → Files picker → book opens and
renders. iOS books are created in the app's Documents directory (visible in
Files under "On My iPhone ▸ finvestlens") with non-colliding naming. Opening a
book from iCloud Drive / Files works: coordinated reads materialise dataless
files; security-scoped access held for the session with bookmark-backed recents;
lockless fallback where the sibling `.lock` can't be created (verified Box Drive
+ iCloud Drive incl. an evicted file). Recents drop entries whose file is gone.
GnuCash/bank-file import and export are intentionally macOS/iPadOS-only
(`FR-PLT-06`, PRD §5.15).

## HIG review (13 Jul 2026)

Fixed: undo/redo (pre-capture, Edit menu integrated), save-on-quit via
`NSApplicationDelegate` (⌘Q never loses data, releases the lock), Reports in its
own window, window titled with document proxy icon, Esc/⌘. cancels sheets
(+ Return confirms reconcile), toolbar help tags, Title Case buttons, undo
action names ("Undo Delete Transaction", etc.).

## 1.0 PRD audit (13 Jul 2026)

Full code review against the PRD before tagging 1.0. Fixed: hardcoded AUD in the
transaction editor (now derives the transaction currency from the splits'
accounts), silent save failures on book-switch/quit/conflict resolution (now
surfaced, quit cancels on failure), transaction-editor errors no longer silently
dismissed, lock heartbeat timer (idle books no longer go stale-breakable),
autosave (5-minute interval), stale importer/OFX comments.
